# Getting started

libgp is a C++ library for Gaussian process regression. A Gaussian process defines a distribution over functions and inference takes place directly in function space. It is fully specified by a mean function and a positive definite covariance function. This library uses two types of covariance functions, simple and composite. Composite functions can be composed of other composite functions, allowing flexible structures. 

## Implemented covariance functions
Follow the standard CMake method of building:

    mkdir build; cd $_
    cmake ..
    make

### Testing the build
Once everything is built, you can check that all works fine with the following tests:

    cd tests
    ./gptest

And running an example:

    cd examples
    ./gpdense

which should return a MSE.

### Building the documentation
There are Doxygen comments in the header files. To compile (make sure you have doxygen installed):

    mkdir doc; cd $_
    doxygen ../doxygen/Doxyfile

Open doc/html/index.html with your favorite browser for the documentation.
If you want a pdf, go into latex and run:

    pdflatex refman.tex

### Simple covariance functions

* Linear covariance function.
* Linear covariance function with automatic relevance detection. 
* Matern covariance function with nu=1.5 and isotropic distance measure.
* Matern covariance function with nu=2.5 and isotropic distance measure.
* Independent covariance function (white noise).
* Radial basis covariance function with compact support.
* Isotropic rational quadratic covariance function. 
* Squared exponential covariance function with automatic relevance detection.
* Squared exponential covariance function with isotropic distance measure.

### Composite covariance functions

* Sums of covariance functions.

### Mean function

* The mean function is fixed to zero.

## Training a model

{{fig1.jpg}} {{fig2.jpg}} {{fig3.jpg}} {{fig4.jpg}}

Initialize the model by specifying the input dimensionality and the covariance function.

    GaussianProcess gp(2, "CovSum ( CovSEiso, CovNoise)");

Set log-hyperparameter of the covariance function.

    gp.covf().set_loghyper(params);

Add data to the training set. Input vectors x must be provided as double[] and targets y as double.

    gp.add_pattern(x, y);

Predict value or variance of an input vector x. 

    f = gp.f(x);
    v = gp.var(x);

## Read and write

Use write function to save a Gaussian process model and the complete training set to a file.

    void write(const char * filename);

A new instance of the Gaussian process can be instantiated from this file using the following constructor.

    GaussianProcess (const char * filename);

## Advanced topics

* hyper-parameter optimization
* custom covariance functions
* the libgp file format

## Requirements

* [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/): cross-platform, open-source build system
* [Eigen3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/): template library for linear algebra
* [googletest](http://code.google.com/p/googletest) (optional)
